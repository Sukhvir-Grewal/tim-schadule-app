        <p>The App does not retain your Google user data beyond the duration of your active session. Once you log out or revoke access, your Google user data is deleted from your local device. You can also manually delete your authorization token and related data from your browserâ€™s local storage at any time.</p>
        <p>If you choose to disconnect your Google account from the App, all access to your Google user data will be permanently revoked.</p>

        <p>Your Google user data is not shared with any third parties. The App only uses your data to provide the services described above.</p>
    
        <h2>6. Compliance with Google's Limited Use Requirements</h2>
        <p>We strictly adhere to Google's Limited Use Requirements, meaning that your data will only be used for the features described in this Privacy Policy and as permitted by Google's policies.</p>
    
        <h2>7. In-Product Privacy Notifications</h2>
        <p>We provide in-product privacy notifications within the App interface to ensure that you are aware of how your data is used. These notifications are displayed prominently to ensure transparency.</p>
    
        <h2>8. Updates to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. When we make changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the bottom of this page. If the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice within the App.</p>
