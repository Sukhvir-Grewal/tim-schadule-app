    <h2>6. In-Product Privacy Notifications</h2>
    <p>We provide in-product privacy notifications within the App interface to ensure that you are aware of how your data is used. These notifications are displayed prominently to ensure transparency.</p>

    <h2>7. Updates to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. When we make changes, we will update the "Last Updated" date at the bottom of this page.</p>
